- sensors to add:
    * advanced GPS - pseudoranges, course, speed, vertical speed
    * rf ranging sensor
    * EM61 - put mesh under ground and do ray tracing to it for em data
    
 - compare new GPS velocity and IMU velocity   
- compare differencing position with get velocity method: http://www.tutorialsforblender3d.com/GameModule/ClassKX_GameObject_19.html    
- compare course and heading from pose to see if sideslip is realistic
- compare wheel encoder readings and velocity or distance moved to see if wheel slip is realistic
